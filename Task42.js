// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magicians = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Penn Jillette', 'Teller'];
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    console.log(magicians);
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = "The Great " + magicians[i];
    }
}
make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
